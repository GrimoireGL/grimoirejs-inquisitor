# Deprecated

Build environment for Grimoire.js was updated.

Now developper can use any test environment since the build environment no more doing something special tasks.

You might try `mocha` , `ava` or something other test framework. If you want to use `ava` for testing, the configurations in `grimoirejs-math` would be helpful to see.
